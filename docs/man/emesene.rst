emesene 2
=========

emesene 2 is an instant messaging client written in Python using GTK.

emesene 2 tries to be a simple but feature complete program that allows to chat
using MSN and Jabber/XMPP based networks.

From it's roots emesene 2 provides a UI that is easy to use by users coming
from Windows Live Messenger but doing special focus on consistency and
simplicity.

Support for Jabber/XMPP based networks through the use of different backends is
provided but without removing features from the main protocol.

Since emesene 2 is a single protocol/account client you will have to start more
than one instance to use more than one account. If you think this is a problem
we recommend clients like pidgin, empathy or kopete that are built to handle
multiple accounts.
